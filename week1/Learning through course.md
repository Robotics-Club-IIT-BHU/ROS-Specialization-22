If learning through text is not your way, we have you covered!!

So, there's a vast number of online courses on ROS online, you are free to explore, but the course we will suggest is [ros-essentials](https://www.udemy.com/course/ros-essentials/).

We will provide you with access to this course on discord server and mentorship WhatsApp groups. If you don't get the access, feel free to dm your respective mentor.
